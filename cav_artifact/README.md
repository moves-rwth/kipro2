# CAV Artifact

Hello and welcome to kipro2's Docker container.

The artifact's main code is in /root/artifact.
  ---> cd /root/artifact

Main documentation and quick start for kipro2:
  ---> nano /root/artifact/README.md

You can find more documentation online in the GitHub repository.

This Docker image contains the full kipro2 code and tools to generate benchmark tables, as well as the paper's PDF file.

We've installed nano and vim for you already.
This image is based on Ubuntu, so you can install your own software with `apt-get update && apt-get install [PACKAGES]`.
